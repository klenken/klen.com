    <p>When I was in the 10th grade my teacher assigned us an activity 
         which is digital art <br>. At first I found it annoying because you know It's a school work.
        <br>But after my first drawing I find it mentally satisfying to see the result of my work
        after an hour. <br> A simple activity turned into a hobby since with it I can express myu imagination through my artwork <br>
        after a month of drawing it lead me to study animation using flipaclip on my mobile device. The first animation video <br>
    was an introductory video and later uploaded it on YouTube. <br> After a month I've met a lot of people from areound the country and share our experiences and gain new friends<br>
