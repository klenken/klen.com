        <p>Arnis is my one and only favorite sports <br>
        I started to like this sport since I cant defend myself <br>
    with my barefand and I'm physically weak. But after some realization <br>
     while cutting some grass using my dagger I'm actually quite good at it
    <br> Swinging a stick and started to train myself. When i reached the 12th Grade <br>
 I muster enough courage to join the arnis team during our sportsfest not gonna lie they're
<br> tough. Combat day has come i was set in the lightweight <br> 
After a long day I emerge victourous and won a gold for the lightweight category </p>
