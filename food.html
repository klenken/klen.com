        <p>Ever since i was seven years old I really like to eat dinuguan together with my late-grandfather <br>
        Every after class he used to cooked this dish since we share a common favorite and not gonna lie <br>
         dinuguan with puto is an absolute combination of sweet and spicy. The type of dimuguan I like is <br> similar to my 
        late-grandfather the sourness of the vinegar is fighting with the spiciness of the chili, also I dont like a dinuguan that has meat 
         in them, I like it when they used the internal organs such as he liver,intestines kidneys and lungs together with hot rice or puto</p>
